<p class="p1"> As one of the most successful and beloved clubs in England, 
    Arsenal Football Club was always a magnet for the public. 
    Tradition-wise, their results speak for themselves; 
    in addition to winning 28 major domestic trophies, 
    Arsenal hold the records for longest unbeaten streak and 
    longest run in top flight of English football.</p>

<p class="p2"> Arsenal FC started life as a works team named Dial Square in 1886 â€“
         the workers were blacksmith's that built cannons, which is the reason 
         for the club being known as the Gunners. Shortly thereafter, 
         the club turned professional and changed its name to Woolwich Arsenal, 
         becoming a full-fledged member of the 
        Football League in 1893 (the first club
         from the south parts of the country).</p>
